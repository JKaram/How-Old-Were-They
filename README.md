## Actor Ages
### https://actor-ages.herokuapp.com/

Actor Ages lets you search for an actor (movies only) and will let you see how old they were while they filmed a particular movie.

**This project is still a work in progress**

## Why is this usefull?

Thats a great question! This is my first projec post graduation. I wanted to practice more with React, APIs and Styling. I guess its not particularly , but I find myself looking up this information manually and thought at least **one** other person might use it.
